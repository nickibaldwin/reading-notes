#Coder's Computer Notes:

### Text Editor: 
Look for:
1. code completion (emmet)
1. syntax highlighting 
1. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
1. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

* Text Edit is bare bones, using VS Code. Another option Atom, Brackets


### Random Notes:
* pwd: Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently
* ls: List the contents of a directory
* cd: Change Directories
