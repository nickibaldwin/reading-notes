#Coder's Computer Notes:

## text editor: 
Look for:
1. Code completion (emmet)
1. Syntax highlighting 
1. A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
1. The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

* Text Edit is bare bones, using VS Code. Another option Atom, Brackets


## random notes:
* pwd: Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently
* ls: List the contents of a directory
* cd: Change Directories
