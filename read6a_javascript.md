# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

### JavaScript 
* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each step is known as a statement, it's green.
* **Code Block** pink curly braces indicate start/end of a code block.
* JavaScript is case sensitive.
* Statements are instructions and each one starts on a new line.
* Statemetns can be organized into **code blocks**. Some statements are surrounded by curly braces.
* Write comments to explain what my code deos!!!
* Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */ anything between the characters isn't processed by JavaScript. They are pink in color.
* Sinlge-line comments are anything that follows //. They are gray in color.
* var quantity; var = **variable keyword**, quantity = variable name
* quantity = 3; quantity = variable name, 3 = variable value
#### Data Types
* Numeric- decimals and whole numbers
* String Data- Letters and characters
* Boolean Data- true or false values only
* JavaScript variable examples pg 63-68

#### Rules for naming variables
1. Name must begin with a letter, dollar sign or underscore, **NOT A NUMBER**
1. Name may contain letters, numbers, $, or ____.
1. Cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords tell the interpreter what to do, ie var is a keyword. Reserved words are words that may be used in future versions of JavaScript.
1. CASE SENSITIVE
1. Use a similar name to what it's storing. ie firstName might be used to store a person's first name. lastName for last name.
1. If the variable is more than one word, use capitals for first letter of following words. ie myNameIsNicki. 
* all lower case is considered camel case. mynameisnicki. Do not use for variables.


### JavaScript (lecture notes)
* It's the functions of the website. HTML is the structure, CSS makes it pretty, and JavaScript makes it function dynamically.
* == compares this side vs that side. apples == oranges
* != not equal
