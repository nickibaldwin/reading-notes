### [Common Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid (and some without!](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/common-responsive-layouts-with-css-grid-and-some-without-245a862f48df)

To learn CSS layouts try copying other CSS layouts and adjust for my own liking, until I better understand and can do off the cufff.

"grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));

The **repeat()** function takes two arguments, the first will define the number of column tracks and the second, what width the tracks should be."

**object-fit: cover**
To stop the images from stretching out of proportion

**grid-gap** property
"Defines the size and space between the row/column."
