# Programming with JavaScript
> Learning the language itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences. 

## JavaScript & jQuery
* JavaScript makes the web page feel interactive by responding to what the user does.
1. **Access** Content- (access the content of the page) Use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. ie select text inside all of the <'h1'> elements on a page.
2. **Modidy** Content- (modify the content of the page) Use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. ie add a paragraph of text after the first <'h1'> element, change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements, change the size of position of an <'img'> element.
3. **Program** Rules- (program rules or instructions the browser can follow) You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow, like a recipe, which allows it to access or change the content of a page. ie a gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
4. **React** to Events- (react to events triggered by the uder or browser) You can specity that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. ie a button pressed, a link is closed, information is added to a form, interval time passed, webpage has finished loading, etc.

* Scripts are a series of instructions for a computer to follow. Much like a recipe, handbook, etc.
* Scripts can run different secions of the code in response to the situation around them.
* Need a clear goal in mind before beginning writing the script.

## Steps to writing script
1. Define the goal
1. Design the script (write the recipe). This can be represented using a flowchart. 
1. Code each step.
