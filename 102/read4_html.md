## process and design
> Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* Who, why, 
* Every website should be designed for **the target audience** not me or the site owner. Let's drive business, not my own agenda.
* Define a clear target audience.
* Individual: age range, gender or mixed, country of origin, avg income, level of education, occupation, what type of device are they on?
* Copmany: size, position of people in company that are viewing site, visiting for themselves or someone else, budget?
* What are the visitors trying to achieve?
* What information do the visitors need to achieve their goals quickly?
* How often is the site updated? ie news sites are constantly updated, while other sites are more stagnant. 
* 

# site maps
* Organize the information into sections or pages.
* Card sorting is a technique to decide which info should go on which page.

# wireframes
* Simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space is might require.
* Basically a rough outline
* Better to show a client the wireframe before design aspects as they can get lost in the designs rather than focus on the content.

# getting your message across using design
* Conent
* Prioritizing- making things stnad out that I want to be noticed.
* Organizing- grouping related content into blocks or chunks to make the page easier to understand. 
* Visual Hierarchy- helps users focus where I want them to. Size, color, style, images.
* Grouping and Similarity- proximity, closure, continuance, white space, color, borders, consistency, headings
* Designing Navigation- concise, clear, selective, context, interactive, consistent.
