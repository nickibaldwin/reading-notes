# Computer Architecture and Logic

## Video Notes
* 4 things common to all computers
1. input
1. storage
1. processing
1. output

* **input**
*  tell the computer what to do with mouse, keyboard, touch screen, watch checkign my heartbeat, gps, drone, etc. 


* **storage/processing**
* computer takes your input and then stores it, processes it through some algorithms and then sends the information back to be stored again. This continues until the processed information is then output.
* CPU converts input into binary numbers and stores it.


* **output** 
* The output depends on the type of device- robot, cell, laptop?
Take binary number and it does something in the world, like sound, car motor, etc
