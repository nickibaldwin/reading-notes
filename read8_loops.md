# Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators:
 == equals
 != not equal to
 <'>/<'> 
 === strict equal to
 !== strict not equal to
 >= greater than or equal to
 <= less than or equal to
* comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. 

## Logical Operators:
* Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

**Comparison Operator** ie (5 < 2)

**Logical Operators** ((5 < 2) && (2 >= 3))
**&&** is logical operator; tests more than one condition. If **both** expressions evaluate to true, then it returns true. If just one is false, then it returns false.

**||** logical or; this operator tests at least one condition. If either expression return true, then the expression returns true. If **both** return false, then the expression is false. 

**!** logical not; this operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it. !(2 < 1) returns true. 2 is greater than 1, but the ! makes this true.


**Loops**
* While Loops: We don't know how many times the could should run, you can use a while loop. 
* For Loop: You know how many time you're going to execute code.
 i = i + 1 is the same as i++ 
 i = i - 1 is the same as i--
* loops generally start at 0, industry standard
