Markdown is basically shorthand coding for GitHub. You can easily make things **bold**, or *italic*. You can also add links and/or images.
Github basically allows software developers to create websites with less middle confusion, you don't even need to know HTML. You can also store pages or documents, or format your website to your choosing.
