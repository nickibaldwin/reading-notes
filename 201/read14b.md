Super interesting article! I find group psychology so interesting (I'm curious if I'll eventually explore UX, but I have little interest at the moment). I didn't really take written notes while reading through like the textbook, but the general gist is group norms have a huge impact on the success of the team.Â 

For positive group work:

- Balanced input from everyone, not just one or two people.

- Teams of super smart, independent people, don't work as well together because they're all right in their minds/too independent. Even input is super important for group success.

- EQ is important and feeling safe within the group.
