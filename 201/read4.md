### Links
- <a href="URLHERE.COM">text that displays user clicks on here</a> 
- <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- Link text is between opening and closing a tags
- You can link to other sites, or other places on your own page.
- Structure directory, go OCD on the folder structure 
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field. 
- Use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
- When linking to a page within my own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URL's

### Layouts
- Containing or parents element- when an element sits inside another block-level element
- Use <div> elements to contain elements to a group on a page
- Floated items require defined width
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels
- Use grid structures for designing pages- **960 pixel grid**
- 

### Functions, Methods, and Objects
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)- Parameters: pieces of information passed to a function
- Return Value: response of a function
- The function is only called on the last line of script
- Declare a function using the keyword function
```javascript
keyword functionName(){ <-- code block inside curly braces>
  document.write('Hello');
}

function sayHello(){
  document.write('Hello');
```
