### CSS

Display property, 
- Block - often default, but removed by css reset. 
- In-line - things are meant to sit next to it
- In-line block; block like structure, so I can give it a height and width, but I want it in line with content around it
- Flex - 

Float is not a display property, it's its own property
- Float - tells the container to sit to the left or right of the surrounding content.

### Flex vs float layouts
- Float is a property in CSS that is a property that wants to think of html, I can display text to people sort of like newspaper. 
  - images and artifacts embedded around blocks of text.
  - Float was a property that was thought of as a way to get elements to float around each other. 
- Flex how do mobile layouts perform well with limited space.
  - Think of a river of elements flowing one way.
  - You can give a container one of two flex properties (row/column).
    -anything that you put in the container, will align itself as a row or column.

Class VS ID: 
  Class is a grouping of content
  ID is an individual use #small in CSS?
identify a class:

    ```CSS
    .small{
      width: 
    }
  ```html
    <div class="namehere"></div>
    ```
