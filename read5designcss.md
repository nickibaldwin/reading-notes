# Design webpages with CSS

### color
* Color can be defined through RGB values 102 red 205 green 170 blue, hex code, or one of 147 predefined color names.
* If you don't specify a white background, it is then transparent based on the users chosen background color. If you want to make sure it's white, specify that.
* Color picking tools in Photoshop or GIMP. Or online at colorschemedesign.com 
* Hue- color. 
* Saturation- refers the amount of gray in color. Maximum saturation there is no gray, minimum saturation is mostly gray. 100% is full saturation, 0% is a shade of gray.
* Brightness- or "value" is how much black is in the color. Max brightness, no black, min brightness would be very dark.

### contrast 
* Contrast- low contrast, text is harder to read on the screen. High contrast- makes it easier to read, but can make it harder to read if there is a lot of text on the page. Medium contrast is great for long spans of text for improved readability. 
* Reduce contrast by using dark grey text on a white background, or off white text on a dark background.

### opacity 
* *CSS3* introduces opacity. 
* Values between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50%, 0.15% is 15%)
* Lightness- 0% is black, 100% is white, 50% is normal
* CSS3 intoduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA. 
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


### randotes 
* CSS allows varying rules on one page; variety of little boxes instead of one big one like in HTML
