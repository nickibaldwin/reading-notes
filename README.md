### About Me 
Hello, I'm a Portland native, but I have been residing in Seattle for the last 8 years. I like pretty things, travel, movement (snowboarding, running, cycling and lagree) and cooking.

### Growth Mindeset
A growth mindset doesn't mean I won't get frustrated, it means I'm collected enough to persevere through it.
* 1 : Habitual Ritual - every damn day
* 2 : Take a 10 minute break when frustrated. Do some stretching, call dam, podcast?
* 3 : Exercise.
