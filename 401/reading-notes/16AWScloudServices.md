## Reading 16: AWS Cloud Services

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

    - How a client flows through an app. The client sends a request to the server, and recieves a response based on their request.

1. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC.

    - The server is what recieves the client/user request. It then decides what to do based on the circumstances - could be connected to a db or API - then sends a response back to client.

1. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

    - Putting it on a web server so it can be used on the internet.

## Vocab:

- Pub/Sub: 

    - Pub/Sub Messaging: "Publish/subscribe messaging, or pub/sub messaging, is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic. Pub/sub messaging can be used to enable event-driven architectures, or to decouple applications in order to increase performance, reliability and scalability."
