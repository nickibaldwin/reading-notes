## Reading 11: Event Driven Applications

1. Why is access control important?
  
    - Regulate who has access to specific data/functionality. Allows you to control who has access to what.

1. Describe an application that would need access control.

    - Canvas - students vs TA's vs instructors etc.

1. What is a role used for?

    - It allows the developer to program who has access to what - ie Brian (lead instructor) can do X, while I'm a student and I'm only allowed to submit. 

1. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

    - The user access can be changed based on role rather than a broader scope.
