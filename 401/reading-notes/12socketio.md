## Vocabulary Terms:

- Observer Pattern

    - "is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)

- Listener

    - Listens for events to occur

- Event Handler

    - Execute an event

- Event Driven Programming

    - "In computer programming, event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)

- Event Loop

    - "responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks." [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#:~:text=JavaScript%20has%20a%20concurrency%20model,languages%20like%20C%20and%20Java.)

- Event Queue

    - "The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution." [Educative](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript#:~:text=The%20event%20queue%20is%20responsible,APIs%20built%20into%20the%20browser.)

- Call Stack

    - "A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc." [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack)

- Emit/Raise/Trigger

    - Fires an event
