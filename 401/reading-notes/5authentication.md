### - Singleton (in CS terms):

    A Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically classes, to instantiate a single instance. This is useful when one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. If tasked with building a middleware system for a singleton pattern, I'd refer to the article below by Medium. But basically model the data and build custom middleware based on the data model.

## Vocab: 
### - Router Middleware:

    "The term is composed of 2 words router and middleware. Middleware. It is a piece of code that comes in the middle of request and response . It kind of hijacks your request so that you can do anything that you want with your request or response eg: Modify the data or call the next middleware."

### - Dynamic Module Loading: 

    "Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory."

### - Singleton Pattern:
  
    "A software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system."
